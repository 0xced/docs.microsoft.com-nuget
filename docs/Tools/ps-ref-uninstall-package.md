# Uninstall-Package

Removes a package from a project, optionally removing its dependencies.

## Usage

```ps
Uninstall-Package [-Id] <string> [-Version <string>] [-RemoveDependencies] [-ProjectName <string>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]
```

If other packages depend on this package, the command will fail unless the â€“Force option is specified.

Id | Specifies the identifier of the package to uninstall. The -Id switch itself is optional.
Version | Specifies the version of the package to uninstall, defaulting to the currently installed version.

ProjectName | Specifies the project from which to uninstall the package, defaulting to the default project.
