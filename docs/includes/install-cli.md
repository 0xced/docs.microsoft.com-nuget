1. On Mac and Linux, install [Mono 4.4.2 or later](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).  1. Visit [nuget.org/downloads](https://nuget.org/downloads) and select the version of NuGet you want.
1. Each download is the `nuget.exe` file directly. Instruct your browser to save the file to a folder of your choice. The file is *not* an installer; running it from the browser won't show anything.
1. Add the folder where you placed `nuget.exe` to your PATH environment variable to use the CLI tool from anywhere.
