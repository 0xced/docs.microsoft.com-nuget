Organizations enables businesses and open-source projects to collaborate across many packages at once using a single NuGet.org identity. For a package consumer, an organization account appears same as an existing user account on NuGet.org. 

## User accounts vs. Organization accounts
Your user account is your identity on NuGet.org. Your user account can be a member of any number of organizations. A package can belong to an organization account the same way it could belong to a user account. Package consumers do not see any difference between an user account or the organization account. Both appear as package `owners`.

An organization account would have one or more user accounts as its members. These members can manage a set of packages while maintining a single identity ownership. 

## Adding a new Organization

To add a new Organization, go to **Manage Organizations** and click on **Add new organization**. 

![manage org option](./media/org-manage-option.png)

![add new organization](TBD)

Once the Organization account is created, you are the Administrator and you can add more members and submit packages against it.

### Transform existing account to an Organization
If you were managing your packages as a team using a single user account and would like to convert the user account into an organization, you can do so through the **Transform your account to an organization** option:

![transform existing account to an organization - option](TBD)

This will bring up the transform page that requires you to provide a user account who would be the Administrator to the newly transformed organization. Please be aware that this is an irreversible process i.e. you cannot transform back to a user account from an organization account you transformed to.
