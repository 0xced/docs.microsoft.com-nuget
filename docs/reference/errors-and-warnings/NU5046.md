# NuGet Error NU5046

<pre>The icon file 'Icon.png' does not exist in the package.</pre>


# Issue

NuGet is unable find the icon file in the package.


# Solution

- Make sure that the file that is marked as the package icon exists at the source and it is readable, and the target matches the path expected by the `icon` property.
- Ensure that the file is referenced in the nuspec or in the project file.
  * When creating a package from a MSBuild project file, make sure to reference the icon file in the project, as follows:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
        <PropertyGroup>
          <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
          <PackageIcon>icon.jpg</PackageIcon>
        </PropertyGroup>
        <ItemGroup>
          <None Include="icon.jpg" Pack="true" PackagePath="" />
        </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

  * When you are creating a package from a nuspec file, make sure to include the icon file in the `<files/>` section:

    ```xml
    <package>
        <metadata>
          <id>sample.lib</id>
          <version>0.0.1</version>
          <authors>nuget</authors>
          <owners>nuget</owners>
          <license type="expression">MIT</license>
          <description>Package containing the icon file</description>
          <icon>icon.jpg</icon>
        </metadata>
        <files>
          <file src="icon.jpg" />
        </files>
    </package>
    ```
