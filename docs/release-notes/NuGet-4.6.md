# NuGet 4.6 RTM Release Notes

[Visual Studio 2017 15.6 RTW](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) comes with [NuGet 4.6.0](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v4.6.0/nuget.exe).

## Summary: What's New in this Release
* We have added support for [signing packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package).  
* Visual Studio 2017 and nuget.exe now verifies package integrity before installing, restoring packages for [signed packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference).
* We have improved performance of successive restores.
* 

## Known issues
### Issues with .NET Standard 2.0 with .NET Framework & NuGet 

.NET Standard & its tooling was designed such that projects targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 can consume NuGet packages & projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0 or earlier. [This document](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481) summarizes the issues around that scenario, the plan for addressing them, and workarounds you can deploy with today's state of the tooling.

### Retargeting target framework version may lead to incomplete Intellisense
#### Issue
Retargeting target framework version may lead to incomplete Intellisense, in Visual Studio. This happens when you are using PackageReferences as the package manager format. [NuGet#4216](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4216)
#### Workaround
Do a manual restore.

### A package in a .NET Core project that contains an assembly with an invalid signature, can trigger an infinite restore loop

#### Issue

Occasionally, when you use a package that contains an assembly with an invalid signature or when the package version is set with 'DateTime' ticker, it causes the package auto-restore to run in an infinite loop [dotnet/project-system#1457](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/1457).

#### Workaround

There is no workaround at this time.

## Issues fixed in NuGet 4.5 RTM timeframe
